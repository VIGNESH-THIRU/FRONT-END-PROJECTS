# FRONT-END-PROJECTS
🚀 I have built several interactive web projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean design, responsiveness, and user-friendly functionality.

🌡 Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter – A real-time temperature conversion tool where users can input a Celsius value and instantly view the Fahrenheit result. It features input validation ✅ and a sleek, responsive interface for smooth usage across devices.

🏙 City Information Website – A responsive website displaying key details about cities, including population, culture, attractions, and weather 🌦. Designed with simple navigation and mobile-friendly layouts 📱 to make information easily accessible.

🔐 Simple Login Form – A modern login form with input validation, password masking 🔒, and clear error messages for incorrect entries. Styled with CSS for a neat and professional look, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics.

💡 Through these projects, I strengthened my skills in front-end development, responsive design, and JavaScript-based interactivity. Each project reflects my attention to detail, creativity 🎨, and commitment to delivering user-focused solutions.
